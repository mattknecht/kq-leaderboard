# KQ Leaderboard Overlay

A live leaderboard overlay for Killer Queen arcade, powered by [HiveMind](https://kqhivemind.com) and [kq.style](https://kq.style).
Thanks to Abby for Hivemind and Kevin J for building the leaderboard server.

Tracks cumulative stats across games at your venue and displays a cycling leaderboard overlay for use in OBS or a browser source.

```
KQ Cabinet → HiveMind → bridge.js → kq.style → index.html (OBS overlay)
```

---

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or newer)
- The `ws` package — run `npm install` in this folder
- Your cabinet ID(s) from [kqhivemind.com](https://kqhivemind.com)
- Players must be signed in to HiveMind on the cabinet for their stats to be tracked

---

## Setup

### 1. Configure bridge.js

Open `bridge.js` and edit the configuration block at the top:

```js
const CABINET_IDS = [1, 2, 3];    // your HiveMind cabinet ID(s)
const SCENE       = "myscene";   // a unique name for your venue's leaderboard
```

`SCENE` can be anything — it creates a leaderboard namespace on kq.style. Pick something unique to your venue so it doesn't mix with other scenes.

### 2. Configure index.html

Open `index.html` and make sure `SCENE` matches what you set in `bridge.js`:

```js
const SCENE = "myscene"; // can pull stats from any scene that exists, probably going to just be what you have in bridge.js
```

### 3. Run the bridge

```bash
npm install
node bridge.js
```

Leave this running during your event. It will automatically reconnect if the connection drops.

### 4. Add the overlay to OBS

Add `index.html` as a **Browser Source** in OBS. Set width to `400` and height to `300`. The overlay will cycle through leaderboard categories automatically.

## Configuration options

### bridge.js

| Option | Default | Description |

### index.html

| Option | Default | Description |

- To reset the leaderboard, contact **@lucidsheep** on the KQ Discord

- Both bridge.js and index.html auto-reconnect if the connection drops
